The first movie that I watched in theatre. My cousin Sandeep took me.

The background theme of titanic is perhaps my favourite theme of all time. Sometimes I put on the headphone and play the theme.

When I listen to the Hymn to the sea, I don't know what it is, Its not the story, not the visuals, but there is something deep, something unexplainable that moves me, makes me all fuzzy.

I think titanic in a way captures the insignificance of our lives when compared to the grandness of the universe. The ship in the vastness of the sea is like our world in the vastness of space. So much of chaos, joy, hatred, love, jealousy which ultimately settles down and disappears into the sea.
