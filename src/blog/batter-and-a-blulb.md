My parents did not force me or nudge me to go into any profession. This allowed me to make own choices on what I wanted to do in live

When I was around 8yrs old, I saw a light bulb glow when it was connected to a battery.
This was a profound moment in my life. I fell in love with the battery and the bulb.
I started playing with it, I started playing with motors and a deep curiosity formed within me to understand who it worked.
And when the time came to choose my path after school, I chose electronics.

I learnt diodes, transistors and a lot about electronics. I built lots of circuits using the transistors, 555 timers and breadboards
